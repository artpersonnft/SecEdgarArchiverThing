The Quest for SEC Scrolls: A Pythonic Adventure
Introduction
Welcome, brave adventurer, to the mystical realm of Python, where you shall embark on a quest not for gold or glory, but for knowledgeâ€”the arcane scrolls of the SEC. This README shall guide you through the installation of the necessary tools, the setup of your environment, and the execution of your script, all while immersing you in a tale of adventure and discovery.

Prerequisites
Before you can begin your quest, ensure your realm (computer) is prepared:

Python: The ancient language of the wise. Download the latest version from python.org. 
pip: The magical tool for installing additional spells (packages). It comes with Python, but ensure it's up to date by running:
bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip

Installation
To install the script's dependencies, you'll need to cast the following incantations:

Open your terminal (the portal to the digital realm).
Navigate to the directory where you've saved charlie.py:
bash
cd path/to/your/script
Install the required packages with:
bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

If there's no requirements.txt, you might need to manually install sec-api or any other libraries mentioned in the script.

The Quest Begins
Your script, charlie.py, is your map and key to the treasure vaults of SEC knowledge. Here's how to embark:

Run the script from your terminal:
bash
python charlie.py

The Adventure
As you run the script, imagine yourself navigating through ancient libraries, each function a room, each loop a corridor:

Explore Functions: Each function might represent a different chamber or vault where scrolls are kept.
Handle Exceptions: These are the traps and puzzles you must solve to proceed.
Output: Your treasure, the scrolls of SEC data, revealed in the terminal or saved to files.

The Quest for SEC Scrolls: A GUI Adventure - Step-by-Step Guide
Your Journey Through the GUI
Step 1: Begin Your Search
Action: Click the Search Button and enter a search term or CIK number.
What Happens: Your command sends out a digital hawk to scour the vast digital libraries of the SEC. This might take a moment, but it will create a CSV file cataloging your findings.

Step 2: Choose Your Scroll
Action: Select a CSV file from the list provided.
What Happens: You're now looking at your catalog of scrolls. Each CSV represents a set of SEC filings or data points you've discovered.

Step 3: Decide How to Retrieve Your Scrolls
Option A: Open CSV Button
Action: Click this to view the data in a tabular format.
What Happens: It's like opening a treasure chest. You get to inspect your loot in detail, seeing exactly what scrolls you've cataloged.
Option B: Download CSV/Crawl Buttons
From CSV: Choose this to download files directly from URLs listed in your CSV. It's like summoning artifacts by their exact location.
From Crawling: Opt for this if you want a more thorough approach. Digital scouts will gather all related scrolls, which might take longer but ensures you get everything.

Step 4: Organize Your Findings
Action: Click the Sorted Files Button.
What Happens: Before you can use your scrolls, they need organizing. This step sorts and cleans your downloaded files, ensuring they're ready for use. Think of it as organizing your spell components before casting.

By the Adventurer's Code: Remember, while this GUI simplifies your quest, the knowledge you seek must be used wisely. Always ensure your actions comply with local laws and ethical standards. The creator of this script, while guiding you, takes no responsibility for how you choose to use this powerful tool.

uWu May your GUI adventures be filled with discovery.

The Functions of Your NO GUI Quest, If one chooses No to GUI, :
1. Archives - The Great Library of SEC
Function: archives_search()Description: This function acts as your magical compass within the vast archives of the SEC. Here, you can search for companies by their CIK number or even by last names, akin to seeking ancient tomes by their title or author. The output is a CSV, your map to further adventures, which can be used with other functions for deeper exploration.

2. CSV - The Scroll of Catalogues
Function: csv_processing()Description: Imagine this as your spell to summon and control the spirits of data. You select a CSV file, which represents a catalog of scrolls you've previously identified.
    You then decide how to retrieve these scrolls:
       URL Extraction: Like calling forth spirits by their true name, you directly download files from URLs listed in the CSV.
       Crawling: A more daring approach, akin to sending out spectral scouts to gather every scroll related to the CIK numbers listed.

3. View-Files - The Inventory Check
Function: clean()Description: Before you can use your scrolls, you must ensure they are not corrupted or cursed. This function performs an inventory check on your downloaded SEC filings, ensuring they are ready for use, much like a mage checking their spell components.

4. Parse-Files - The Arcane Analysis
Function: parse()Description: Here, you delve into the essence of the scrolls. This function deciphers the arcane symbols and texts within the SEC filings, extracting meaningful information. It's your moment to understand the ancient knowledge, converting raw data into insights.

69. AllYourBaseAreBelongToUs - The Forbidden Spell
Function: sec_processing_pipeline()Description: In the realm of Warcraft III, this would be akin to casting a spell so powerful it summons an entire army or, more fittingly, commands all units to attack. This function, if unleashed, would initiate a process to download EVERY SEC filing, filling your digital realm (hard drive) with data, much like how a Night Elf might call upon all forest creatures to defend their homeland, overwhelming the enemy with sheer numbers.
