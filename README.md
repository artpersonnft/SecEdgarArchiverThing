Introduction
Welcome, brave adventurer, to the mystical realm of Python, where you shall embark on a quest not for gold or glory, but for knowledgeâ€”the arcane scrolls of the SEC. This README shall guide you through the installation of the necessary tools, the setup of your environment, and the execution of your script, all while immersing you in a tale of adventure and discovery.

Prerequisites
Before you can begin your quest, ensure your realm (computer) is prepared:

Python: The ancient language of the wise. Download the latest version from python.org. 
pip: The magical tool for installing additional spells (packages). 
It comes with Python, but ensure it's up to date by running:
bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip

Installation
To install the script's dependencies, :

Open your terminal (the portal to the digital realm).
it should autowhip them all into creation, in the same folder the script was ran from.

Since the script is your map and key to the treasure vaults of SEC knowledge,
The Quest Begins with the following incantations..
Here's how to embark:

The Quest for SEC Scrolls: A GUI Adventure - GUI Guide

Your Journey Through the GUI
Step 1: Begin Your Search
  Action: Click the Search Button and enter a search term or CIK number.
  What Happens: Your command sends out a digital hawk to scour the vast digital libraries of the SEC. This might take a moment, but it will create a CSV file cataloging your findings.

Step 2: Choose Your Scroll
  Action: Select a CSV file from the list provided.
  What Happens: You're now looking at your catalog of scrolls. Each CSV represents a set of SEC filings or data points you've discovered.

Step 3: Decide How to Retrieve Your Scrolls
  Option A: Open CSV Button
  Action: Click this to view the data in a tabular format.
  What Happens: It's like opening a treasure chest. You get to inspect your loot in detail, seeing exactly what scrolls you've cataloged.
  Option B: Download CSV/Crawl Buttons
  From CSV: Choose this to download files directly from URLs listed in your CSV. It's like summoning artifacts by their exact location.
  From Crawling: Opt for this if you want a more thorough approach. Digital scouts will gather all related scrolls, which might take longer but ensures you get everything.

Step 4: Organize Your Findings
  Action: Click the Sorted Files Button.
  What Happens: Before you can use your scrolls, they need organizing. This step sorts and cleans your downloaded files, ensuring they're ready for use. Think of it as organizing your spell components before casting.

The Functions of Your NO GUI Quest, If one chooses No to GUI, :

1. Archives - The Great Library of SEC
-Description: This function acts as your magical compass within the vast archives of the SEC. Here, you can search for companies by their CIK number or even by last names, akin to seeking ancient tomes by their title or author. The output is a CSV, your map to further adventures, which can be used with other functions for deeper exploration.

2. CSV - The Scroll of Catalogues
-Description: Imagine this as your spell to summon and control the spirits of data. You select a CSV file, which represents a catalog of scrolls you've previously identified.
  You then decide how to retrieve these scrolls:
    -URL Extraction: Like calling forth spirits by their true name, you directly download files from URLs listed in the CSV.
    -Crawling: A more daring approach, akin to sending out spectral scouts to gather every scroll related to the CIK numbers listed.

3. View-Files - The Inventory Check
-Description: Before you can use your scrolls, you must ensure they are not corrupted or cursed. This function performs an inventory check on your downloaded SEC filings, ensuring they are ready for use, much like a mage checking their spell components. Displays all downloaded CIK's as converted company names, and allows for viewing of filings.

4. Parse-Files - The Arcane Analysis
-Description: Here, you delve into the essence of the scrolls. This function deciphers the arcane symbols and texts within the SEC filings, extracting meaningful information. It's your moment to understand the ancient knowledge, converting raw data into insights. (searches company filings for a keyword).
much faster than view-files.

69. AllYourBaseAreBelongToUs - The Forbidden Spell
-Description: This is akin to casting a spell so powerful it summons an entire army or, more fittingly, commands all units to attack. This function, if unleashed, would initiate a process to download EVERY SEC filing, filling your digital realm (hard drive) with data, much like how a Night Elf might call upon all forest creatures to defend their homeland, overwhelming the enemy with sheer numbers.
